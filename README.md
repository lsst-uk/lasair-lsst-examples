# Lasair Tutorials

This repository is dedicated to a suite of tutorials to help you get started with using Lasair to accept the LSST Alert data. 
For Further information we have [ReadTheDocs](https://lasair-lsst.readthedocs.io/en/main/) pages, and their relevant subsections will be sign posted where relevant in these tutorials 

## How to use these examples?

There are two kinds of resources covering the same themes:
* **Notebooks**, which are detailed step-by-step jupyter notebooks explaining how the code and data work. 
* **Scripts**: which are self-contained and well commented code examples that can be copy-pasted directly.  
* **Features**: notebooks which explain exactly what is happening in the computation of the light-curve and other features in the Lasair schema

Generally speaking the notebooks and features will have more explanations because they allow for more verbose descriptions.
