<h1 align="center">  Lasair LSST Tutorials </h1>

---

This repository is dedicated to a suite of tutorials to help you get started with using Lasair to accept the LSST Alert data. 
For Further information we have [ReadTheDocs](https://lasair-lsst.readthedocs.io/en/main/) pages, and their relevant subsections will be sign posted where relevant in these tutorials 

## How to use these examples?

There are two kinds of resources covering the same themes:
* **Notebooks**, which are detailed step-by-step jupyter notebooks explaining how the code and data work. 
* **Scripts**: which are self-contained and well commented code examples that can be copy-pasted directly.  

Generally speaking the notebooks will have more explanations because they allow for more verbose descriptions. 

## How to get help?

If you have a question or need any help, you can find past questions or as a new one on the **[Community Forum](https://community.lsst.org/c/support/support-lasair/55)**.
